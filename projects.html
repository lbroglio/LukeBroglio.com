            <h3>Project Overview</h3>
            <p>My Digital Logic course involved working with a student-designed simulated CPU which had its own assembly language and CPU instructions. I designed and wrote a C++ program to convert code in the CPU's assembly language to machine code instructions for the CPU.</p>
        
            <h3>Project Details</h3>
            <p>The assembler consists of three parts each with their own C++ file.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><p>The parser is responsible for taking in code from a specified file and formatting it to be easily read during assembly. It removed all comments and unnecessary white space from the code, made a list of all conditional jump locations, and separated the data segment from the code segment.</p></li>
              <li><p>The main assembler was responsible for creating the machine code from the parsed code. For each line, it started by using a dictionary to get the binary identifier for the line's Opcode and then used an if statement to decide how to generate the rest of the line's corresponding machine code.</p></li>
              <li><p>Finally, the code would be sent to various functions to properly format the code and output it to the required files. The code was outputted into four different files. Three Verilog HDL files could be used to program the simulated CPU, and one .bin file presented the generated machine code along with information on its variables, register usage, and conditional jumps.</p></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Challenges of this project</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><p>The first challenge I had to overcome with this project was ensuring the assembler wouldn't trip on the code if it was formatted differently. I had never worked with programs with inputs this complicated before, so I had to practice how to do this. I solved this by having the parser carefully ensure that everything was spaced out by adding and removing spaces to ensure that exactly one space was used throughout the code.</p></li>
              <li><p>The other major challenge I had to overcome was ensuring that the assembler could elegantly access the different types of data it needed. The program needed to know the line numbers of conditional points, the assigned memory location of user-created variables, and the proper ordering of certain elements. I relied heavily on data structures to solve this. I associated the names of jump points with their line number in a map to allow quick access to the location based on the name found in the code. I used the same method for storing user variables' locations with their names and utilized vectors to store the information I wanted to access in a set order.</p></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Project Overview</h3>
            <p>SpamGram is a minimalist location-based social media app developed by a team of Iowa State University students, including myself. The app uses location data to only serve the user posts made within a short distance of them and features an anonymous and minimal approach to user profiles.</p>
        
            <h3>Project Details</h3>
            <p>SpamGram has three major components.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><p>The first component was the front-end UI for the app. The front-end was developed in React Native and was also responsible for generating user profiles</p></li>
              <li><p>The second component was the back-end program written in NodeJS. The back-end was responsible for mapping requests between the user and the database. I primarily worked on the back-end component.</p></li>
              <li><p>The third component was a MongoDB database which stored the users and message data. The database was responsible for storing the location messages were posted, and Mongo queries were used to ensure users only received messages posted close to them.</p></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Challenges of this project</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><p>The first challenge of this project was learning the tools and strategies needed to effectively write software collaboratively. I learned how to use Git effectively and got practice with Agile developement.</p></li>
              <li><p>Our other major challenge was determining how to integrate our desired features. From the start, we knew that we wanted the app to be anonymous and to have very minimal account features, but we also wanted users to be able to keep track of their posts and replies. Our solution was to use an account system with a preassigned random user name and profile picture. To avoid keeping track of passwords, we authenticated every log-in request by sending a text to a user's phone number with a code they could enter into the app.</p></li>

          <h3>Project Overview</h3>
          <p>For one of my computer science classes I created a game in C++ that plays in the terminal with roguelike mechanics and pokemon style capture and battle systems. In the game users explore a map made out of different tiles and fight more powerful trainers and pokemon as they go farther from the center</p>
      
          <h3>Project Details</h3>
          <p>Most of my time on the project was devoted to three different elements.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><p>The first element was the map. Each map tile was comprised of different biomes, which started as a single space and grew out, stopping when they hit another biome. After the biomes were placed, it was randomly decided whether or not buildings should be added to the map, with the choice weighted so buildings closer to the center of the map would have buildings more often. Finally, roads were drawn on top of the map, linking the buildings and all of the entrances and exits. Dijkstra's algorithm was used to draw the roads, and it was weighted to avoid placing roads on water or mountains when possible. </p></li>
            <li><p>The second component was the back-end program written in NodeJS. The back-end was responsible for mapping requests between the user and the database. I primarily worked on the back-end component.</p></li>
            <li><p>The third component was a MongoDB database which stored the users and message data. The database was responsible for storing the location messages were posted, and Mongo queries were used to ensure users only received messages posted close to them.</p></li>
